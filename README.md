# Learning Projects

Hi, I’m Adaobi 👋  
I’m a Computer Science graduate learning and improving my coding skills.

This repository contains small practice projects and experiments as I grow in:
- Problem solving
- Writing clean and simple code
- Using tools (including AI) to learn effectively

More projects will be added as I continue learning.
